# week3_move
This demo shows what it's like to put the user "on rails". The user is moved along at a constant velocity and cannot deviate from the intended path.

Virtual Reality can easily induce nausia if there are quick changes in speed or direction, so keeping the user as a constant velocity is frequently the best way to navigate a scene.
